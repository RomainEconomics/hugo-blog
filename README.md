# Website

This repository contains the source code for my own website.

It is deployed using Cloudflare Pages at this address: <https://blog.romainjouhameau.com/>

I've used [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the [Blowfish theme](https://blowfish.page/) to create this website.

To run it locally (with `git` and `hugo` already installed), you can use the following commands:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:RomainEconomics/hugo-blog.git

cd hugo-blog
hugo server --noHTTPCache
```
